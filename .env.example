# Google Gemini API Configuration
# Get your API key from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Authentication Credentials (for Vercel deployment)
APP_USERNAME=your_username
APP_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env.local
# 2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials
# 3. NEVER commit .env.local to git - it's in .gitignore for your protection
#
# For Vercel deployment:
# - Set these same variables in your Vercel project settings
# - Go to Settings → Environment Variables
# - Add API_KEY, APP_USERNAME, and APP_PASSWORD
# - Apply to Production, Preview, and Development environments
